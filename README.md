To deliver the "Try EDA" experience, we have created an EDA playground - a repository that contains everything you need to install and provision a demo EDA instance with the virtual network on the side. 

#Installation:
Proceed with cloning the EDA playground repository that contains everything you need to install and provision a demo EDA instance.

```
git clone https://github.com/nokia-eda/playground && \
cd playground
```
